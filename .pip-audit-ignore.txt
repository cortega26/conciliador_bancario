# pip-audit ignore list (one vulnerability ID per line).
#
# Format:
#   PYSEC-YYYY-NNNN  # expires: YYYY-MM-DD  reason: short justification
#
# Policy:
# - Prefer upgrading dependencies over ignoring vulnerabilities.
# - If an ignore is necessary, always include an expiry and a reason.
# - Expired ignores fail the gate (forces re-review).
