name: release (deprecated)

# NOTE:
# The automatic "bump version + tag + push" mechanism now lives inside `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
# as the `release` job (gated on push->main with CI green).
#
# This workflow is kept as a stub to preserve historical references and avoid tooling/tests that
# expect the file to exist. Do not wire it back without also removing the `release` job in CI.
